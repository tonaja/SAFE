      <h2>Inefficiency in Attendance Tracking</h2>
      <p>Traditional attendance methods are inefficient, as attendance sheets may not reach all students, and some students may mark attendance for their peers. Additionally, students might leave after registering their attendance.</p>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <h2>Distractions During Lectures</h2>
      <p>Various disturbances during lectures, such as phone ring tones, student conversations, and other noises, can significantly distract students and affect their concentration.</p>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <h2>Lack of Student Behavior Monitoring</h2>
      <p>There is a need for a system that not only tracks attendance but also monitors student behavior during lectures to provide feedback for further study and improve the overall quality of education.</p>
